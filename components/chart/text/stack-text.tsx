const stackText = "A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO). This means the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first. You can think of the stack data structure as the pile of cup on top of another, you cannot access cups in the middle or bottom without removing the top cup."
