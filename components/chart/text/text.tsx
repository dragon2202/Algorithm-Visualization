const stackText = "A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO). This means the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first. You can think of the stack data structure as the pile of cup on top of another, you cannot access cups in the middle or bottom without removing the top cup."
const queueText = "A queue is a useful data structure in programming. It is similar to the ticket queue outside a cinema hall, where the first person entering the queue is the first person who gets the ticket. Queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first."
const hashtableText = "The Hash table data structure stores elements in key-value pairs where Key- unique integer that is used for indexing the values. Value - data that are associated with keys. In a hash table, a new index is processed using the keys. And, the element corresponding to that key is stored in the index. This process is called hashing."
